A simple (NOOB) script to change between 2 themes and wallpapars on Ubuntu Budgie 20.04 at specified times during the day/night.
_____________________________________

A. INTRO:

Surprisingly, I was unable to find anything else similar to this. So i put this script together to do the job for me and maybe help you if you're looking for a quick solution.

The only app i found was AutomaThemely (https://github.com/C2N14/AutomaThemely)
But it did not install on my pc for reasons unknown to me (I didn't try hard enough maybe). If it works for you then i think it's way better than mine.

B. DISCLAIMER:
1. I'm no programmer, don't expect this to work on all systems.
2. I've only tested this on my own system runnung Ubuntu Budgie 20.04.
3. I don't think you need to install any additional dependencies.
4. If you would like to test it on other systems and create a GUI for it, you're welcome.
5. I will try to improve it if i have the time & others can point me in the right direction
